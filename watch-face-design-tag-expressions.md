# **Creating a Watch Face Using Tag Expressions in Samsung Watch Face Studio**

## **Introduction**

Samsung Watch Face Studio is a versatile tool that allows designers to create custom watch faces for Wear OS smartwatches. This platform provides a user-friendly interface that caters to both beginners and experienced developers. One of its powerful features is the ability to use **Tag Expressions** for dynamic and functional watch face designs.

In this guide, I will demonstrate how to create a watch face that dynamically displays the **battery level** using **Tag Expressions**. Additionally, the battery level color will change based on specific conditions:

* **Red**: When the battery level is ≤ 20%.  
* **Green**: When the battery level is \> 20%.

This step-by-step process will help you understand the fundamentals of using Tag Expressions in Samsung Watch Face Studio.

## **Steps to Create the Watch Face**

### **Step 1: Open Watch Face Studio**

1. Install and open **Samsung Watch Face Studio** on your system.  
2. Create a new project and select a circular watch face template.

### **Step 2: Add Battery Level Display**

1. **Add a Text Component**:  
   * In the left panel, click on **Text** to add a text layer to your watch face.  
   * Set the text to display the battery level using the tag:  
     `Battery Level: #BL#%`  
2. **Customize the Text**:  
   * Adjust the font size, position, and color to match your design preferences.  
   * Set the default color to **Green** (\#00FF00).  
3. **Apply Tag Expressions**:  
   * Select the **Text Component**.  
   * Go to **Properties** \> **Color**.  
   * Add a Tag Expression for the color field:  
     \[\#BL\# \<= 20\] ? \#FF0000 : \#00FF00  
     * This expression changes the color to **Red** (\#FF0000) if the battery level is ≤ 20%.

### **Step 3: Add a Circular Progress Bar**

1. **Add a Shape Component**:  
   * From the **Shape** menu, choose **Ellipse** and add it to your watch face.  
   * This will represent the battery progress.  
2. **Customize the Progress Bar**:  
   * Go to **Ellipse Properties** and set the **Progress Value** to:  
     \#BL\#  
   * Adjust the thickness, color, and size of the progress bar as needed.  
3. **Apply Dynamic Color**:  
   * Just like the text, use the same Tag Expression for the progress bar color:  
     \[\#BL\# \<= 20\] ? \#FF0000 : \#00FF00

### **Step 4: Test Your Watch Face**

1. Use the preview feature in Watch Face Studio to test the dynamic battery level display.  
2. Ensure the color changes appropriately based on the battery level.
